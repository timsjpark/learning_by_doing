### How to assemble Betty Crocker's SassyOven

Begin your pseudo-culinary experience by opening irb with the following code:

```
irb -r './my_object.rb'
```

Once you have opened irb, you can assemble your oven with one easy step!

```
oven = SassyOven.new
```
All done?! Good...you're well on your way to burning your first dish...

### Guidelines for using your SassyOven

**Rule # 1** - Don't sass back.

**Rule # 2** - The oven is always right, ALWAYS.

**Rule # 3** - If you mess up, the SassyOven will let you know. If you can't
handle the sass, maybe you should grow some backbone and come back.

### SassyOven features

**Temperature**

`oven.temp` will print out the current temperature.

**Self Cleaning Mode**

`oven.self_clean` will make the oven self clean, obviously. A good time to do this is
right after you burn some food. I'm going to go ahead and guess that you'll probably 
be using this feature a lot...

**Open the door**

`oven.open` - c'mon does this really need any explanation?

**Close the door**

`oven.close` - I don't even know why I'm telling you that you might need to open or
close the oven door. If that's not obvious., I have no idea how you're still alive.

**Preheat**

`oven.preheat` will preheat the oven. Wow. This instruction manual is dry...

**Broil**

`oven.broil` will make the oven bake at a super hot temperature. Don't burn yourself!

**Bake**

`oven.bake` will let you bake anything you want. I recommend that you stick to putting
food in the oven, but if you don't want to take my advice, you might want to have 911
on speed dial.

**Off**

`oven.off` turns the oven off. Don't forget to do this so you save energy, which
reduces your impact on the earth, which obviously saves baby seals in some circuitous,
vague way. Oh...your oven will also explode if you don't turn it off when you're done.

### GOOD LUCK ###
